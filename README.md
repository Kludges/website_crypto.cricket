# website_crypto.cricket

This repository includes all production files and source code used in producing the <a href="http://crypto.cricket" target="_blank">crypto.cricket</a> technical security blog, including:

* @dfkt's bespoke Nibbleblog theme, itself derived from Rafael Medina Garc√≠a's <a href="http://www.rmedgar.com/" target="_blank">'techie' theme</a>... our theme is formally credited as follows: _"A theme inspired by Gaia/Firefox OS, fake root certs, Mike "test2" Espresso, and pancakes."_
* source code (php) of the nibbleblog engine itself, including any modifications we've done to it during our curation of the blog (which mostly include bugs introduced inadvertently during pj's attempts at debugging)
* production content files in the form of images, text, and the magic elixir of clarified angel's tears whipped into a foamy exuberance in combination with eye of Newt (whoever that is)
* other stuff we forget about now, but will describe later in boringly-specific detail
* ...profit.


Long Live The Cricket!
